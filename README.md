SUMMARY
Due to the popularity of generative artificial intelligence [AI], represented by CHAT GPT, global big tech
companies are developing and upgrading related services one after another, changing the search market as well
as the information and communication technology [ICT] industry. Since the term Artificial Intelligence was first
specified at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, research for technological progress has been actively conducted
in various fields. However, it underperforms the investment and goes through two dark periods called the so㈸
called ㉣AI winter㉤. It was regarded as a disruptive technology that would revolutionize society and industry, but
this was largely due to the failure to produce tangible results. Fortunately, however, AI is entering its golden age
again today thanks to quantum leaps in computing power and data processing technology, as well as advances
in problem㈸solving methodologies. Among them, CHAT GPT, the most representative AI technology for the public,
caused a syndrome by exceeding 10 million daily users in just two months after its launch. CHAT GPT is a
technology that AI processes and responds to requests for data collection, organization, error review, etc.
through chat. As it achieved more than expected results even though it was a test version, the market, which had
been hesitant about investing in AI, questioned its profitability, The atmosphere is also changing.
However, there are problems with these technologies, and the most frequently covered content in the media is
cheating, such as assignments and tests, and hate speech, spread of sexual and racial prejudice, unauthorized
theft of information such as various copyrighted works, and fakes due to generalized usability. Issues such as
news and information generation follow. Generative AI can operate only when it learns a large amount of existing
content, so there are lawsuits against related copyrights, and it is a situation that can cause social problems by
injecting wrong information. There are concerns that there is a high possibility that technology that efficiently
utilizes generative AI will be abused and recognized as an illegal tool.
Accordingly, Insight GPT combines AI and blockchain, the core of the 4th industry, to provide a new type of AI
platform for individuals, developers and companies, thereby solving the problems of existing AI platforms and
moving forward with AI platforms in the future. We would like to suggest a direction for them to move forward.
In addition, through Insight GPT, we aim to create a structure in which the two businesses can grow together by
solving problems that are occurring not only in artificial intelligence but also in blockchain using AI.
